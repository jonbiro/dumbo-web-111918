## Additional key questions
* switch - why vs if/else
* filter and/or map
  * reduce

# Scope
* Global scope
* Function scope and var
  * reassigning
* Block scope
  * let
    * re-declaring
  * const
    * re-assigning



## global
- Can access them ANYWHERE :(
## var
- function scope ("leaks" out of blocks)
- re-declare in the same scope with no error :(
## let
- block scope
- can reassign
- get an error if you try to re-declare in the same scope :)
## const
- block scope
- can NOT reassign
- get an error if you try to re-declare in the same scope :)
